## start 
- git clone 
- make sure you have react-native cli, if not, run this command in the terminal: npm install -g react-native-cli
- npm install
- react-native link
- request for the sensitive.json file from me, or use your own firebase credentials. Place the sensitive.json file in the root directory.
- can run "react-native run-ios", or go to ios folder, and open init.xcodeproj to run in xCode. 
- I recommend running the app by building the app into your phone, as the alert boxes run very slow in expo or a simulator. Open ios/init.xcodeproj, plug in your phone into your computer, and choose the option to build into your phone.
